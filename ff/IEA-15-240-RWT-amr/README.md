Model for:

- OpenFAST: v3.4
- ROSVO:    v2.3 (see ServoData)

- Regis used Monopile, so we use Monopile as well.
- CpCtCq: generated by Regis






Possible Modifications:
 - Allowed "IPC" in ServoDyn so that pitch offset (faults) can be used in ROSCO
 - Negative pitch offset used to decrease CT






Potentially we could use the onshore version in the future (need to rerun AMR Wind...):  
    Compatible with IEA-15-RWT repository with the onshore "flavor" provided in the following repository
